## voice_recorder
A simple Python voice recording program for database generation inspired by [ProRec](https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/prorec/).

The GUI is made using the cross platform Python framework [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) (v1.11.1).

The program reads .xlsx files in the test folder that contain text the user need to read.
